# Project: Smart Plant Monitoring System with ESP32

## Introduction
Measurement/Control/Visualization of the environment for tropical plants
The goal of the project would be to create a system that measures key environmental parameters (such as temperature, humidity, light levels, soil moisture) for tropical plants.
This system should also allow the user to control or adjust environmental conditions and visualize the data.

This project was developed by Gerson Hauwanga, Adri√°n Macias and Mario Loizaga. The aim is to create a smart environmental monitoring system using an ESP32, sensors for temperature, humidity, light, and soil moisture, along with an integrated web server for real-time data visualization.

The system measures and displays sensor values on an OLED screen and transmits this data through a web interface. It also includes LED control based on detected light levels and a buzzer alert for critical soil moisture conditions.

We have developed the project using Thonny, a programming environment that allows us to interact directly with microdevices like the ESP32.
By programming in MicroPython, we can create, delete, modify, automate, control, and improve device functions to build a final project that meets our exact requirements.
To achieve this, it is essential to have a solid understanding of MicroPython and the ability to write efficient code that aligns with our objectives.
Additionally, a foundational knowledge of timers, displays, and synchronous/asynchronous communication is beneficial for comprehending the operation of microcontrollers and sensors.
Subsequently, we will create or utilize the files outlined later and upload them to the ESP32 to enable the use of these modules when executed from the main program.
