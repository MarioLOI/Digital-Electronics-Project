# Measurement/Control/Visualization of the environment for tropical plants

The goal of the project would be to create a system that measures key environmental parameters (such as temperature, humidity, light levels, soil moisture) for tropical plants. This system should also allow the user to control or adjust environmental conditions and visualize the data.

Inspiration:

    Climate Chamber System

Possible components:

    Plant terrarium
    I2C temperature and humidity sensor
    Photoresistor
    Soil moisture sensor
    OLED display
    RGB LED strip Neopixel WS2812B
    Relays
    Brushless DC fan, NMOS transistor
    ESP8266 Wi-Fi module
